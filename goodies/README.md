# Client Goodies

Client goodies are experimental tools used to generate helpful things for the client.

## Generating svg in html pages

Sometimes, you need a lot of rectangles, and you want them in very specific places.
You can use a script to generate them, because writing out each one would be
far more work for a human than a computer. A human is good at coming up with a
mathematical equation, which can be fed into a computer as instructions.  These
instructions can do awesome things: like generating a ton of verbose svg rectangle
elements. See [makeSvg.py](makeSvg.py).
